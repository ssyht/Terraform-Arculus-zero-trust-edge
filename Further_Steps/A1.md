## First Further Step:

## Create the hosts (exactly the ones the manual expects)

*Terraform does: provision EC2 instances you’ll log into and run the repo steps on.*

**Pick one:**

(i) Single-host testbed: one EC2 (the manual’s “Arculus Host Machine”) where you’ll run everything.

(ii) Three-host split (UI / API / DB): three EC2s; you’ll still run the same script on each, but start only the service that belongs there (UI on UI box, etc.). This doesn’t change the repo—it just mirrors your teaching plan.

TF sketch (role tags only; nothing auto-installing):
```
resource "aws_instance" "ui"  { /* ami, subnet, SGs */ tags = { role="ui"  } }
resource "aws_instance" "api" { /* ami, subnet, SGs */ tags = { role="api" } }
resource "aws_instance" "db"  { /* ami, subnet, SGs */ tags = { role="db"  } }
# or a single "arculus-host" if doing the one-box path
```
