## B2) Clone repo & run the setup script (unchanged)
```
git clone https://github.com/arculus-zt/arculus-sw.git
cd arculus-sw
chmod +x arculus-setup.sh
./arculus-setup.sh
```

* When the script prompts for the MySQL password and 256-bit key, paste the values Terraform generated (or use strong values you choose).

* If you enabled CHN for your course, the script will also ask for the CHN URL & keysâ€”supply them exactly as the manual shows. (Terraform can provision a CHN box, but you still follow the CHN setup flow manually per the doc.)
