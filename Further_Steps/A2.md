## Open the exact ports the manual uses (no extras):

**Terraform does**: security groups that match the manual’s firewall matrix (HTTP/HTTPS for UI, web ports 3000–3003 used by UI/API, docs 6006 if you’ll open it, honeypot API 5000 if you plan to touch CHN, and DB 3306 between API→DB). If you’ll demo clustering/k3s later, include TCP 10250 and UDP 8285/8472 inside the VPC.

**Why**: so that, when you finish the manual’s setup, the UI is reachable on :3000, the backend can reach the DB, and any optional pages you choose to show work without console edits.

**TF sketch (example):**
```
# UI externally reachable (adjust to class CIDR)
ingress ui: 80, 443, 3000-3003 from 0.0.0.0/0
# API only from UI SG on app port; allow 5000 if you’ll show that page
ingress api: 3000-3003 from sg-ui; (optional) 5000 from VPC CIDR
# DB only from API
ingress db: 3306 from sg-api
```
