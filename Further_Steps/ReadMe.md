## A. Before you run the manualâ€™s script

Follow the steps from A1 to A4.


## B. Run the exact manual steps on the VM(s)

From here on, you do precisely what the PDF says on each host. Terraform is done until you need more hosts.

## B1) SSH/Session into the instance(s)

 - Use whatever the manual suggests (SSH or Session Manager). Terraform has already created the instances & SGs.
